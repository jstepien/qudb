qudb
====

qudb is a Quite Useless DB. You really shouldn't use it yet. Learn a bit more on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/qudb).
You can also take a look at the occasionally refreshed
[documentation of qudb's internals](http://jstepien.github.com/qudb/).

Run tests using `test/Test.lhs`.

As this is my first project in Haskell I'd be really grateful for any comments.
